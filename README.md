# NorxManaged
A C++ port (in .NET CLR, with a C# tester) of the NORX AEAD stream cipher, part of the CAESAR competition

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!  
NORX was NOT chosen as a final candidate in the CAESAR competition, so I'm not sure where that leaves this algorithm if it isn't tweaked more to address the issues raised during analysis.

Go to https://norx.io/ for developments, the official spec and repository https://github.com/norx/norx , and CAESAR here http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar.html
